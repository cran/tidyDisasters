# We will create a table of the type of disasters  based on the classification 
#  of the Hazard Definition and Classification Review Technical Report
#  published by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (2020)
# This script will create a table matching the type of disasters reported by 
#  FEMA and Mark Macgowan and Catalina Canizares opinion regarding the hazard
#  cluster it should belong to
