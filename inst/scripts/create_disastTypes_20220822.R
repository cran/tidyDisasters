# Create Table of Type of Disasters

# Now that we have a unique key for all events (by state, year, and month), we
#  will create a table of the type of disasters based on the classification 
#  of the Hazard Definition and Classification Review Technical Report
#  published by the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (2020)
#  Annex 6 page 72.

#### Loading data sets ####

# The following table was downloaded from the Hazard Definition and 
#  Classification Review Technical Report  published by the UN Office for
#  Disaster Risk Reduction (2020) Annex 6 page 72, to match the type of disaster
#  reported by FEMA, GTD AND EMDAT and the suggested classification. The process
#  was done by converting the pdf into a word document and then copying and 
#  pasting to an xlsx file.

#  In our data set we only have floods, for this first version we 
#  are going to assume that all flood are meteorological and hydrological 
#  for the future we will check which floods are technological.

#### FEMA #####

#  to each type of event reported.

# Joined the table created with the matches and all the events reported in FEMA

#  sub type of event suggested by the UN, we are going to join to annex 6 to 
#  get the hazard type.

# There are 296 less cases because FEMA has a category called OTHER. 
#  Dr. Macgowan and Catalina agreed that this category should be maintained as 
#  other, however the UN report does not hold that category, therefore the inner
#  join kicks those cases. To add the OTHER category I decided to do an antijoin
#  and then bind both data sets.
