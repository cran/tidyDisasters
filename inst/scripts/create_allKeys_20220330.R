# Serting our super ID to identify each event
# Catalina Ca√±izares and Gabriel Odom
# 03/30/2022

# To move the project forward and obtain functional tables from the merge of
#  FEMA and EMDAT we need to create a key. Dr. Odom and Catalina have agreed
#  upon creating a key that will contain the beginning year, month, state and
#  a 4 random number at the end that will identify the same event although it
#  touches different counties.
