######  Raw to SPSS  ##########################################################
# We downloaded the raw data set from <https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm>
#   We are interested in only the high school data. The data sets are
#   "Districts (dat)" in ASCII form; the SPSS script is "SPSS Syntax (sps)",
#   which contains definitions for classes, labels, and missing values. 
# CATALINA TO ADD: detailed notes of how that script had to be modified, and a
#   copy of that modified script (dated).
# We imported the data into SPSS, then saved as "YRBS_hs_district_1991-2019.sav".
#   Finally, because the data are highly sparse, we save it in R's compressed
#   data format.

hs_district <- read_sav("data_raw/YRBS_hs_district_1991-2019.sav")
saveRDS(hs_district, "data_raw/hs_district.rds")



######  Import  ###############################################################

# This code tells R the design elements in the survey (PSU, Weights, Strata)
## It should be used for analysis because ignoring the PSUs will tend to yield 
## standard errors that are too small, leading to false positives when doing 
## significance tests (https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/seminars/survey-data-analysis-with-r/).

######  Explore  ##############################################################

# This exploration is done assuming  simple random sampling

# What can I find in this data sets? Type of variables, years of data, locations... 

glimpse(ms_district)
glimpse(hs_district_df)

# These tables allow me to see years and district where there is available data

table(ms_district$sitename, ms_district$year)
table(hs_district_df$sitename, hs_district_df$year)
## More districts are available in the data set from high schools

#### Wrangle ##################################################################

# Cleaned the sitename vector. Separated the city from the state and the 
## abbreviation. Eliminated the word "county" and "burough of". Eliminated
## special characters such as "(),"

# I did it!! but, Dr. Odom, how do I transform this into a function?

#### Now, exploring with weighted data #####################################

# This function will give me the number of PSUs per strata
